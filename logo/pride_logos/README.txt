Pride Logos by: Ari Carter [KKZ]

Made on Procreate using Clipping Masks. 
This could reasonably be achieved on any program with a clipping mask functionality.

Can be used for any sort of novelty logo, Discord emoji, etc.
Make sure to export them in a file format that supports transparency otherwise 
the mask will create a white background.
